### Review

1. Why is the Context API useful?: The react context API is a way for React App to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. [Link](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/async/react-context-api/#:~:text=The%20React%20Context%20API%20is,to%20state%20management%20using%20Redux.)

2. Can a component outside of a provider get its context?: You could do so with the use of class component via the static contextType.

3. What are some common use cases for using the Context API?: Context API allows state to be shared among components.

4. Describe “Context Hell”: A scenario where you have multiple sets of Context which this means an abundance of global variables.

### Define

- global state: In casual domain, a global state is a set of local states which are concurrent with each other. 
- global context: Items can be scoped globally and accessed via child elements. 
- provider: The provider component makes the Redux store available to any nested components that need access to the redux store.
- consumer:
