## 401 Reading Notes

Write the following steps in the correct order:
1. Receive access token
    * Make a request to the access token endpoint
    * Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
    * Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
    * Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
    * Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
    * Receive authorisation code
8. What can you do with an authorisation code?
9. What can you do with an access token?
10. Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

### Define 
- Client ID: A Client ID represents a unique browser or device which is created.
- Client Secret: A client secret is a secret only known to your application server. It protects your resource by only granting tokens to authorised requestors. 
- Authentication Endpoint: Endpoint authentication is a security mechanism designed to ensure that only authorised devices can connect to a given network, site or service. [Link](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/endpoint-authentication)
- Access Token Endpoint: The oath token endpoint is used by the application in order to get an access token or refresh token. [Link](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/protocol-oauth2)
- API Endpoint: API endpoint is the point of entry in a communication channel when two systems are interacting. This refers to touch-points of the communication between an API and a server. [link](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/endpoint/#:~:text=In%20simple%20terms%2C%20an%20API,an%20API%20and%20a%20server.)
- Authorisation Code: An authorisation code is an alphanumeric password that authorises its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security protected space.  [LINK](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorization-code.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20an%20Authorization%20Code,into%20a%20security%2Dprotected%20space.)
- Access Token: Access token is an object encapsulating the security identity of a process or thread. A token is used to make security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity. [LINK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_token#:~:text=An%20access%20token%20is%20an,information%20about%20some%20system%20entity.)

### Preview 
Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
- OAuth is a was that you can authenticate tokens with specific calls. There are different types of Oauth within an architecture. Renew access tokens are valid for usually a period of time. 
Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
- Learning about general Auth and authentification. 
- How a server will respond to those events
- If middleware handles the OAuth events with encryption. 
What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
- It will be fun to create a login for a webpage
