## 401 Reading Notes

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
- You can run all the tests to ensure they work
- Write the code that is simple and passes a test
- Refactor your code

2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
- beforeEach() can be used before an event takes place so we could initialize a database. Followed by afterEach() which could clear out the results in a database. 

3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
- It is a slow process and consumes time because there are many steps involved

4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
- A big difference between class and prototype-bases inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at a runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance. [Link](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/es6-class-chaos-keeps-js-developer-up#:~:text=Prototypes%20vs.,is%20itself%20an%20object%20instance.&text=A%20constructor%20in%20JavaScript%20is,function%20that%20returns%20an%20object.)

5. Why REST?
- When yoy develop a public api, and gives you extensive object information.

## Define
- functional programming: Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functional-programming-paradigm/#:~:text=Functional%20programming%20is%20a%20programming,is%20%E2%80%9Chow%20to%20solve%E2%80%9D.]

- object-oriented programming (OOP): Object oriented programming is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. [https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP#:~:text=Object%2Doriented%20programming%20(OOP)%20is%20a%20computer%20programming%20model,has%20unique%20attributes%20and%20behavior.]

- class: Classes are a template for creating objects, they encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JavaScript are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class like semantics. [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes]

- super: Super is a keyword used to access and call functions on an object's parent.
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super]

- this: This is a keyword and behaves a little differently in JavaScript compared to the other languages.
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this]
- Test Driven Development (TDD): Test-Driven Development is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed. 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#:~:text=Test%2Ddriven%20development%20(TDD),software%20against%20all%20test%20cases.]

- Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity.
[https://jestjs.io/]

- Continuous Integration (CI): Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. [https://www.cloudbees.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration]

- REST: Reprenstional State of Transfer
- Data Model: A data model is an abstract model that organizes element of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model#:~:text=A%20data%20model%20(or%20datamodel,properties%20of%20real%2Dworld%20entities.]

## Preview
1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
- TDD is becoming clear because it's a great way to ensure you code passes a test before it is pushed up
- A WRRC diagram is a great way to visualize a REQ and RES
- How module.exports helps with writing code

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
- How to refactor code
- How to efficiently write code
- What is a common way to write consistent code

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
- Back end development is more rewarding than i anticipated and i am enjoying the process.
