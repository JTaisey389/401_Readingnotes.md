)
2. If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?: I am not entirely sure how to emulate it, but if we want local container images to display in multiple places I could set up a system where a file is stored on one server and is duplicated as needed.

3. Describe how a CDN works: A content delivery network, is geographically distributed network of proxy servers and data servers.
