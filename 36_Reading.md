## 401 Reading Notes

## Readings: Application State with Redux

### Review

1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage” : Cookies are more secure and additionally more convenient because of the pure JavaScript. Cookies work with API's that require an access token in the header.

2. Explain 3rd party cookies: Third party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one that you are currently on

3. How do pixel tags work?: A tracking pixel is a graphic with dimensions of a 1x1 pixel that is loaded when a user visits a webpage or opens an email. 

### Define

- cookies: An http cookie us a small piece of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser while on a website.

- authorization: Authorization is a security measure to determine access levels or user client privileges related to system resources.

- access control: Access control within a computer generally includes identification, authorization, authentication, access approval and audit. 

- conditional rendering: Within react you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. From there you can render only some of the conditions depending on the state of the application.
