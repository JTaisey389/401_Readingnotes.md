## 401 Reading Notes

### Class 01 
**1. Describe (in plain English) what Array.map()does**
- Array.map is a method that creates a new array which is populated with the results of calling a provided function on each element in the calling array. 

**2. Describe (in plain English) what Array.reduce()does**
- Array.reduce is a method that performs a reducer function which is provided by you on each element of the array, and the results produce a single output value.

**3. Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result. Use normal Promise.then() syntax***

`app.post('/searches/new', (req, res) => {`
  `let bookSearch = req.body.bookSearch;`
  `let search = req.body.search;`
  `let url = `https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=in${search}:$`{bookSearch}`;
  `superagent.get(url)`
    `.then(returnData => {`
      `const bookArr = returnData.body.items.map(bookSearch => new Books(bookSearch)``);`
      `console.log(bookArr);`
      `res.render('pages/searches/show.ejs', {bookArr:bookArr});`
    `})`
    `.catch(error => {`
      `console.log(error);`
      `res.status(500).send('Sorry something went wrong with bringing your books` `back, please pay the fee');`
    `});`
`});`

***Example from my book app*** https://github.com/JTaisey389/book_app/blob/main/server.js

**Again with async / await syntax**
- const getCityData = (name) => {
  superagent.get(`https://geocode.xyz/${name}?json=1`)
  .then((data) => {
    const parsedData = JSON.parse(data.res.text)
    if(parsedData.error){
      console.log(parsedData.error.description)
    } else {
      console.log(`latitude: ${parsedData.latt}, longitude: ${parsedData.lognt}`)
    }
  }).catch(error => {
    console.error('Well, somthing is wrong', error)
  })
}

async function cityData(city) {
  try{
    await getCityData(city)
  } catch(error){
    console.error('Ehhhh somthing went wrong', error)
  }
}

cityData('Seattle')
cityData('ihroewbr33492')

***Example from my Async/Await code challenge*** https://replit.com/@JTaisey389/AsyncAwait#index.js

**4. Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 Level student
- A promise could be thought of as an event that will eventually take place, and what the user will get back is either a resolved or rejected. Think of it as a match game with cards and youâ€™re trying to match those cards. If you get the wrong card that is a rejection, well if you match it would be resolved. 

**5. Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why not?**
- Callbacks invoke other functions so it's like your gathering them all together to complete a task. On the other hand an Asynchronous function waits for a promise and really it will depend on the use of the code. You could have a promise within a callback function waiting for a part of the code to be resolved or rejected.
