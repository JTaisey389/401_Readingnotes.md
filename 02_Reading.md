## 401 Reading Notes

### Class 02
1. What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
- The main difference in PUT and PATCH method is the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource. PATCH on the other hand supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource. 


2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
- [https://www.mock-server.com/]
- [https://github.com/nock/nock]
- [https://beeceptor.com/]


3. Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
- 404 Not found
- 403 Request is forbidden
- 500 Internal Server Error

4. Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
- SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol whereas REST stands for Representational State Transfer
- SOAP is a protocol whereas REST is an architectural pattern
- SOAP only works with XML formats whereas REST works with plain text, XML, HMTL and JSON.
 **Here's a great link for where I found my resources [https://www.guru99.com/comparison-between-web-services.html#:~:text=SOAP%20stands%20for%20Simple%20Object%20Access%20Protocol%20whereas%20REST%20stands,REST%20is%20an%20architectural%20pattern.&text=SOAP%20only%20works%20with%20XML,can%20make%20use%20of%20SOAP.]

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
- Web Server: A web server is a computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP.

- Express: A minimal and flexible Node.JS web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. [https://expressjs.com/]

- Routing: The process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing]

- WRRC: Web Request Response Cycle

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
- What the WRRC does and how a backend developer interacts with the WRRC
- How a callback is used to chain multiple functions together
- There are a lot of similarities to how API's are written with app.get

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
- It would be great to learn more about the middleware and how that interacts with WRRC
- How compartmentalizing your code makes you a better Software Developer
- How CI CD is a beneficial role to the Software Developer but also the WRRC

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
- I am most excited for being able to work with a programing language like react and incorporating that into my JavaScript.
