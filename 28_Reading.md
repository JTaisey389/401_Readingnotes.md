## Readings: Component COmposition

### Review

1. Can a parent component access the state of a child component?: The common way would be to use a callback function that the child component to trigger and toss the state values upward. This sounds very familiar to hoisting, but hoisting moves declarations to the top.

2. What can be passed along in a prop variable?: Lots of data can be send into a component when you are calling on that component. Props are used to send data from one React component to another React component. [Link](https://blog.logrocket.com/the-beginners-guide-to-mastering-react-props-3f6f01fd7099/)

3. How can a child component “know” the state of another component?: You could pass a components state to its child components as props. [Link](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/can-a-component-access-the-state-of-another-component/394157)

### Define

- component props: Components let you split UI into independent reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. [Link](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

- component state: A components state is when an event takes place for a prop. The state is managed by the component and so props are passed into the component to change the current state. [Link](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html)

- application state: This refers to the current state of where your application is at.

### Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- A slightly better understanding of state
- What an application is and how it contains components and can be changed with props
- React is a dynamic environment

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- Learning more about state
- Using components consistently
- Working with state

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- I think I would like to see how components play into the state of the framework
