## 401 Reading Notes

## Readings: Component Based UI

### Review

1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React) [Link](https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-ui-frameworks/)

- Ext JS
- Angular
- Vue
- Ember
- Svelte 3

2. Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?

- The difference between a framework and a library lies in a term called inversion control. When you use a library, you are in charge of the application flow.

### Term

- Rendering: Rendering or image synthesis is the process of generating a photorealistic or non-photorealistic image from a 2D or 3D model by means of a computer program. [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics))

- Templates: A template is a pre-created document that already has some formatting. This is so you do not have to start from scratch every time you open up a document.

- State: When a system is described as stateful it is designed to remember preceding events or user interaction; the remembered information is called the state of the system. [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science))

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- I am looking forward to setting up templates
