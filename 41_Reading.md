## Readings: React Native

### Review

1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”: Redux toolkit provides a lot functions that can simplify working with redux. The challenge you run into with redux is that it can become a very heavy application quite quick with a lot of dependencies. This is where we introduce ducks which is a proposal for building reducers, action types, and actions all into the same file.  

2. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit: It allows a developer to write more efficient code, spreed up the development process, and automatically apply the best-recommended practices. [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-redux-toolkit-and-why-it-is-more-preferred/#:~:text=It%20allows%20us%20to%20write,build%20a%20large%20scale%20application)

### Define

- redux toolkit slices: A function that accepts initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice" name, and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state. [Link](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSlice)

- namespace: In computer science a namespace is a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to object of various kinds

### Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- What redux's core is
- How redux has a lot of power
- What a redux slice does

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- Redux toolkit
- Namespaces
- Ducks

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- I would like to know more about this ducks thing with redux.
