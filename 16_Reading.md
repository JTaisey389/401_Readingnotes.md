## 401 Reading Notes

## Readings: AWS Cloud Servers

### Review

1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle: The best way to describe a **WRRC** is that it is a set of actions that take place. A client such as a computer makes a **Request** on a website that is hosted on the **web**. That **Request** has a route to follow that is sent over to a server to await a **Response**. Once a call is made to the server the server processes what the client is asking, and sends back a **Response** on the same path. This complete's the **Cycle** of the **WRRC**, so for every time you want data from a website a **WRRC** takes place.

2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC: A server holds the information that is being requested by a user and in a way is like a big file vault that contains limitless information. Most times servers are holding information for an **API** which is a specific database of information.

3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?: When you deploy your application that means that you are putting a web page onto the internet. The **deployed** website is an application that lives on the internet and information is stored in a **server**. You access the information on the server through the **Web-Request-Response-Cycle**

### Define

- Server: A server is a system that holds information for a specified website or API call.
- Pub/Sub: When you want an event to take place like distribute a package and you need to notify a delivery company a **publish** event takes place to push out that event. As that event takes place a hub is **subscribed** to the event to listen and make sure the **published** event finishes up and is complete.

### Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- What a WRRC is.
- How pub and sub interact within a WRRC
- At the root of most of the web is a server that holds information.

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- Learning more about the integration of pub and sub.
- Is there a best way to set up a pub and sub event?
- If part of a pub or sub event is missed does that interrupt the WRRC?

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- The integration of pub and sub!
