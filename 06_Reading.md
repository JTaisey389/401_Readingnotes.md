## 401 Reading Notes

1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)

- Singleton pattern is a software design patter that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)

2. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes. 

- Singleton pattern can be used with node modules because of how singleton is set up to instantiate one single instance. Node would only fire once thanks to setting up  a class of an object. 

3. If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?

- I think my approach would to model the data to see what we would be passing in as information. With that approach custom middleware can be designed for the application; moreover, this can push the emphasis of TDD.

### Define

1. Router Middleware: Chainable middleware with familiar req.params and req.query if identical routing is what you are typically used to.

2. Dynamic Module Loading: Dynamic loading is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory.

3. Singleton Pattern: Singleton pattern is a software design patter that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)

4. CRUD -> REST Method Matches:
CREATE -> GET
READ -> POST
UPDATE -> PUT
DELETE -> DELETE

5. Mock Testing: Mock testing is an approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules.

Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- I can't think of three things as the moment, but CRUD and REST are just about drilled into my head.

Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- I hope to learn more about how the singleton pattern will be integrated with compartmentalized code. 

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- I am enjoying the testing of an application.
