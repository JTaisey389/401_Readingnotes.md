## 401 Reading Notes

## Readings: Props and State

### Review

1. Does a deployed React application require a server?: You don't need a static sever in order to run a Create React project. React can generate it's own port when initializing.

2. Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?: By testing at a behavior level the user can take small bits of code out at a time and that makes it easier to get to a proof of life for the project. Of course the downside to this testing is that it takes time and can be slow because it's small chunks.

3. What does npm run build do?: NPM run build creates a build directory with a production build of your application. [Link](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#:~:text=npm%20run%20build%20creates%20a,.js%20file.)

4. Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application: Within React the key feature to the application is the ability to create components. This creates the basic architecture within your code and allows the developer to fill in the blanks as needed.

### Define

- BDD: Binary Decision Diagram is a data structure that is used to represent Boolean Functions. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram)

- Acceptance Tests: This is a level of software testing where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluates the systems compliance with the business requirements. [Link](https://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/acceptance-testing/#:~:text=ACCEPTANCE%20TESTING%20is%20a%20level,or%20writing%20that%20big%20check)

- mounting: With computers to mount is to make a group of files in a file system structure accessible to a user or to a user group. [Link](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/mount#:~:text=In%20computers%2C%20to%20mount%20is,in%20a%20position%20to%20operate.)

- build: In software development, a build is the process of converting source code files into standalone software artifacts that can be run on a computer. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_build#:~:text=In%20software%20development%2C%20a%20build,the%20result%20of%20doing%20so.)

### Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- Binary Decision Diagram
- What is an acceptance test and how to implement them
- How mounting can help a software developer access certain code within the computers environment

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- Learning more about the use of state
- How the architecture of React works
- Is there a best way to set up an initial framework for react

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- I am looking forward to working with React because it appears to be far more intuitive than other programing architectures
