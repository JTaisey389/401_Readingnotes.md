## Readings: AWS Cloud Servers

### Review

1. Describe “The Cloud”: The cloud is described as the on demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without active interaction by the user. [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)

2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?: A container consists of an entire runtime environment with an application plus all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries, and configuration files needed to run it, which are bundled into a single package. [Link](https://www.cio.com/article/2924995/what-are-containers-and-why-do-you-need-them.html#:~:text=Put%20simply%2C%20a%20container%20consists,it%2C%20bundled%20into%20one%20package.)

3. What is auto-scaling?: Auto scaling is a service provided by AWS that monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. [Link](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/)

4. What is bandwidth?: Bandwidth is how much information you receive every second, while speed is how fast that information is received or downloaded. [Link](https://www.verizon.com/info/definitions/bandwidth/)

5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?: When establishing a price, could providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. This is calculated based off of the network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor.

### Define

- Server Instances: A server instance is a collection of SQL server databases which are run by solitary SQL server service or instance.
[Link](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32149/server-instance#:~:text=A%20server%20instance%20is%20a,based%20or%20command%2Dline%20based.)

- Containers: Containers consist of runtime environment with application plus all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries, and configuration files needed to run it.

- Cloud Services: Cloud services are providers who provide data storage with computing power.

- Cloud Architecture: Cloud architecture refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. [Link](https://www.hcltech.com/technology-qa/what-is-cloud-architecture#:~:text=Cloud%20Architecture%20refers%20to%20the,as%20the%20relationships%20between%20them.&text=Cloud%20resources,-Software%20components%20and)

- AWS: Amazon Web Service

- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku: When deploying a web application to Heroku and to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, these are used in production configurations, contrasting their implementations and pricing. [Link](https://codeburst.io/heroku-v-s-aws-elastic-beanstalk-1cc6f12ca3c7)

### Preview:
